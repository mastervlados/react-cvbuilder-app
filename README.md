# React CV-Builder App

> ### In the process of finding my first job in IT, Iâ€™m facing with the fact - some employers need a CV in English, others in Russian. As soon as I got acquainted with the capabilities of React and Context API, an idea immediately came to my mind - to solve this problem qualitatively. Iâ€™m sure that my future HR managers will be comfortable using my application. They have the opportunity to choose the desired language and print my CV with up-to-date data
